# getXAuth

A Flutter GetX Authorization example with injection dependency and no Splash screen.

- The app will detect whether the user is already logged in and redirect it to the corresponding screen before it loads.
- An on boarding screen is shown when the app is started for the first time. After the first start, it will show a login or home screen.
- The button `Unset On Boarding Done` will remove the flag for the On Boarding screen which will make it appear again if the app is restarted.

**NOTE** This is just an example I took from a project I am currently working on. If you like it, please star it; otherwise, leave me a comment in the issues section with ideas on how we can improve it.
